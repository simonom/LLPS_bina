## Examples on how to call the different functions

Here I provide a simple set of example scripts that calculate various properties according to some SMILES strings listed in a '.prop' file. You can modify which method is called and change temperature, or work with your own input '.prop' file. The extension is used to simply illustrate the procedure for calculating a range of properties, and is a text file.

Please note, these files are not deisgned to be run directly from this subfolder within your UManSysProp distribution. You will need to change the location of your existing UManSysProp distribution in these example python files. This is clearly indicated in the source code.
